 Welcome to Pride's Tamagotchi

 You will find that the current game is incomplete and is still a work in progress. Within this repository you will find the steps that I took to create my site so far.

 So I began brainstorming about what I wanted Pride's Tamagotchi's layout to look like and I decided to use a wireframe site called MockFlow(screenshot inserted).

 After the layout was drawn out I proceeded to create html, css and javascript files.

 I searched google to find my Lion King themed images and to also find an appropriate background image that would fit the site.

 After I acquired what I wanted to use, I proceeded to create my HTML syntax elements, an input element and also a few button elements. 

 I proceeded to work heavily on my css file. Trying to orient each element correctly wasn't the easiest part of this project but it was definitely not the hardest either. 

Next comes the hard part for me personally, JAVASCRIPT!!!
So I proceeded to creating my variables for the button elements I created by using getElementsByClassName DOM Manipulation. I then attempted to create a function that would run an EventListener whenever I clicked on my buttons, but I find it hard to grasp creating functions on my own.
